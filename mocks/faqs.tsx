                With our subscription service, you can submit as many design
                requests as you want. We work on one request at a time, ensuring
                each task gets the attention it deserves. After one task is
                completed, we immediately start on your next request. All tasks
                are tracked on a Trello board which you’re invited to
                immediately after signing up.

                Custom design turnaround time depends on the complexity of the
                task. Once you add a task we’ll review and append an estimated
                timeframe for approval before we get started. The average turn
                around time is 2 business days per task
